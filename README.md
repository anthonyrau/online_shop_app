# online_shop_app
In our online store application, the user interface has two pages, one for the product page that has a horizontal list of categories and then a list of our products. Then, on the details page, show the price and a short description of the product with the Buy Now button. The best part of our ecommerce app is that each product has its own color that looks great.
